:star: A collection of solutions.

## Submodules
Since everyone will maintain it's own set of solutions it makes more sense to make use of submodules. Which basically are repositories inside of one repository.

## Add existing project (recommended)

If you already have your own solutions on your GitHub profile you can simply add that as a submodule here.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Cubicle-VIP/advent-of-code-.git [<custom-dirname>]
$ git submodule add https://github.com/<user>/<project> [<custom-dirname>]
```

## Initialize new repo

I recommend that you first create a repo locally, push this to your own GitHub repositories and then follow above instructions. If you don't want to do this you can initialize a new submodule the following way.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Cubicle-VIP/advent-of-code-.git [<custom-dirname>]
$ mkdir <your-name>
$ cd <your-name>
$ git init
```
